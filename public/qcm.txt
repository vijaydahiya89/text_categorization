Passage:
India has a unified legal profession governed by the Advocates Act of 1961.  The entry to the
profession is perhaps less rigorous than it ought to be.  The standard qualification for the entry is
graduation in law rather than any practical training.
    At present there are about 500 law colleges of
varied quality.  The nature of legal education is relevant not merely for professional competence.  It
also determines how far a lawyer cultivates his professional obligation to his client, to Courts and to
the society at large.  The present relaxed entry to the profession has led to a prolific number of
lawyers approaching 500,000, a distinction exceeded only by the United States.
